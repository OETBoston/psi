But we'll take a bit of poetic license and use the term more broadly. The projects in this category broaden green infrastructure to include the full range of ecological systems that sustain urban life: growing food, cycling nutrients through compost, filtering water, and creating spaces where communities can cook and share what they grow. Over four Public Space Invitationals funded by TD Bank and developed with The Trustees, we explored different aspects of this expanded definition. Some projects focused on traditional green infrastructure like rain gardens and stormwater filtration. Others addressed the infrastructure of urban food systems, from community gardens to composting networks to portable kitchens. Each project worked to make these resources more accessible, understandable, or usable. Garden Delivery brought customized planters to residents when pandemic closures cut off access to community gardens. The expansion of Project Oscar made composting infrastructure more recognizable through artist-designed bins. El Agua es Vida transformed a forgotten school rain garden into an educational resource. Cooking Together created a mobile kitchen for gardeners to prepare and share harvests. And Little by Little revealed how rain gardens filter stormwater through a kinetic installation. Each intervention made green practices more tangible and woven into neighborhood life.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Pop-up Infrastructure","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/psi/pop-up/","content":"Pop-up Infrastructure Trailer Made at Chilcott &amp; Granada Community Garden Cities are full of spaces that sit empty or dormant most of the time. A plaza between morning and evening commutes. A community garden on weekdays. A park corner that never quite attracts a crowd. Pop-up infrastructure responds to this reality by creating interventions that can move. Pop-up infrastructure is mobile and adaptable, bringing play and learning spaces anywhere in the city with simpler, more nimble installations. These projects demonstrate that infrastructure doesn't have to be permanent to be impactful. Instead of building permanent fixtures that serve one location, these projects pack up, travel, and activate multiple sites with a single set-up. The projects in this category share a commitment to portability and flexibility. This mobility offers practical advantages: lower upfront costs than permanent construction, the ability to test ideas before committing to fixed locations, and the opportunity to serve multiple communities with a single investment. Read on to see how the teams from Uni, Kit of Parks, and Trailer Made created flexible infrastructure that refreshes any space it enters.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Public Works, Reengineered","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/psi/public-works/","content":"Public Works, Reengineered Peter Agoos siting on Seat Light Control at the Old South Meeting House Most city infrastructure serves a single purpose. Street light or traffic control boxes house an array of electronics. Well caps on sidewalks provide access to measure water levels underground. These assets fulfill their technical requirements and nothing more. The assumption is that operational infrastructure shouldn't try to do anything else; it just needs to work. But technical necessity and public engagement don't have to be mutually exclusive. Infrastructure can perform its required function while also inviting public interaction and use. The key is reengineering: rethinking the orientation of equipment, the accessibility of data, and the physical form of structures. When designers approach existing infrastructure with the question &quot;What else could this do?&quot;, operational elements can become public amenities. Seat Light Control and LightWell demonstrate this possibility. Peter Agoos transformed street light control boxes into benches that seat eight people while still controlling the lights on Washington St. in Boston. Michelle Laboy, Joshua Fiedler, and Seth Wiseman made groundwater monitoring systems visible and understandable through illuminated benches and mobile apps while maintaining the ability to access and measure groundwater. One project completely reengineered existing infrastructure; the other augmented existing wells with new technology to make their data visible. Together, they suggest that operational infrastructure has untapped potential to do more for the public.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Simple Tools, Simple Materials","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/psi/simple-tools/","content":"Simple Tools, Simple Materials Painting the Franklin Street Neighborway Not every problem in public space requires sophisticated technology or complex engineering. Some of the most effective interventions come from thoughtful applications of basic materials -- paint, tape, wood, and creativity. Projects in this category prove that changing the streetscape can be as straightforward as using what's already available in new and unexpected ways. Whether it's using paint to create daylighting and calm a busy road or building lightweight structures to bring a community together, these projects are easy to prototype, refine through testing, and often have the most potential to scale across the city. Simple materials mean simpler permitting processes, lower barriers to entry for community groups, and simpler, though more frequent, maintenance over time. When a project succeeds with basic tools, it becomes a template that neighborhoods can adapt without specialized expertise or massive budgets. These interventions are also more forgiving and perfect for prototypes; if an experiment doesn't work as planned, the investment in time and money remains manageable. By proving that meaningful change doesn't require expensive materials, these projects democratize urban design. Read more about this approach in action by learning about Neighborways and the practice of Liz LaManche.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Technology + Participation","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/psi/technology-participation/","content":"Technology + Participation The Public Radio installation in South Boston In most public spaces, you experience technology passively. When technology is interactive, it's personal -- on your phone or in your headphones -- isolating you from the people around you. Some public artists have offered a different approach: shared, interactive technology that invites strangers to participate together. They use technology to give people agency over their environment, inviting them to shape what they see and hear in shared spaces. Instead of being passive recipients, people can become active participants who can adjust, influence, and personalize their surroundings. The technology becomes a tool for expression and control rather than something that washes over us. These projects also demonstrate that participatory technology does not require expensive or proprietary systems. Built with accessible tools like microcontrollers and open-source software, they invite replication and adaptation. When teams document their work and share their code, one installation becomes a template others can build from, spreading the model of public participation through technology across different communities. Explore how these principles played out in Public Radio and our own DIY electronics at Boston City Hall.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Storytelling + History","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/psi/storytelling/","content":"Storytelling + History Kim Barzola with her mural at Stories from the Garden | Credit: Sofía Perez Whose stories get preserved and who decides which voices matter? Mainstream history tends to favor certain perspectives or prominent individuals, while overlooking the everyday experiences of residents who make neighborhoods what they are. Our storytelling projects challenge that pattern by creating space for community members to document their own stories, in their own words, through art. When residents become collaborators in documenting their own neighborhoods, the result carries authenticity that outside observers might miss. Both Real People, Real Stories: Mattapan and Stories from the Garden turned personal stories into lasting community archives. Through the facilitation of Poet Laureate Danielle Legros Georges and composer Anaís Azul, portraits, poems, songs, murals, and interviews emerged as artifacts that communities can recognize as their own -- displayed in library windows, on streaming platforms, on painted banners, and in digital archives. The artists created space for people to preserve their own histories through public art and performance.","keywords":"","version":"Next"}],"options":{"id":"default"}}
