When technology is interactive, it's personal -- on your phone or in your headphones -- isolating you from the people around you. Some public artists have offered a different approach: shared, interactive technology that invites strangers to participate together. They use technology to give people agency over their environment, inviting them to shape what they see and hear in shared spaces. Instead of being passive recipients, people can become active participants who can adjust, influence, and personalize their surroundings.
